abstract={The advances in distributed renewable generation technologies in recent years have started to cause load balancing issues in power networks. Distributed energy storage (ES) systems, although seen as a tool to mitigate the stress on local networks, tend to be operated only to minimize the energy cost of their direct owner. In this paper, cooperative game theory is used to construct an energy grand coalition, in which ES system operations are optimized to minimize the coalitional energy cost. Case studies then show that forming energy coalitions is effective in reducing the variability of a local network load profile. The resulting cooperative game is mathematically proven to be balanced, which means the energy cost savings from the cooperative ES operation can be allocated to the players within the energy grand coalition in a manner that disincentivizes them from exiting from the grand coalition to form smaller coalitions.},

abstract={Distributed energy storage (ES) is widely regarded as a tool to mitigate the supply-demand imbalance caused by intermittent generations and variable loads in a distribution network. Because a retail supplier generally offers a lower electricity sell price (e.g. feed-in tariff) than its buy price, ES owners are monetarily incentivized to store excess generation for later usage. However, since each ES owner typically optimizes the ES operation based on their individual usage profile, the joint load balancing effect of multiple ES systems becomes insignificant. This paper proposes an energy coalition, in which ES system owners operate collaboratively to minimize the total coalitional energy cost. Using cooperative game theory, the nucleolus and Shapley value are developed as methods to reward players. Finally, selected case studies compare the load balancing effectiveness of noncooperative and cooperative ES operations, and empirically demonstrate the nucleolus's stablizing characteristic, which incentivizes prosumers to stay within the grand coalition.},

abstract = "Peer-to-peer trading in energy networks is expected to be exclusively conducted by the prosumers of the network with negligible influence from the grid. This raises the critical question: how can enough prosumers be encouraged to participate in peer-to-peer trading so as to make its operation sustainable and beneficial to the overall electricity network? To this end, this paper proposes how a motivational psychology framework can be used effectively to design peer-to-peer energy trading to increase user participation. To do so, first, the state-of-the-art of peer-to-peer energy trading literature is discussed by following a systematic classification, and gaps in existing studies are identified. Second, a motivation psychology framework is introduced, which consists of a number of motivational models that a prosumer needs to satisfy before being convinced to participate in energy trading. Third, a game-theoretic peer-to-peer energy trading scheme is developed, its relevant properties are studied, and it is shown that the coalition among different prosumers is a stable coalition. Fourth, through numerical case studies, it is shown that the proposed model can reduce carbon emissions by 18.38% and 9.82% in a single day in Summer and Winter respectively compared to a feed-in-tariff scheme. The proposed scheme is also shown to reduce the cost of energy up to 118 ¢ and 87 ¢ per day in Summer and Winter respectively. Finally, how the outcomes of the scheme satisfy all the motivational psychology models is discussed, which subsequently shows its potential to attract users to participate in energy trading."

abstract={In this technical note, we are concerned with constrained consensus algorithms for distributed convex optimization with a sum of convex objective functions subject to local bound and equality constraints. In multiagent networks, each agent has its own data on objective function and constraints. All the agents cooperatively find the minimizer, while each agent can only communicate with its neighbors. The consensus of multiagent networks with time-invariant and undirected graphs is proven by the Lyapunov method. Compared with existing consensus algorithms for distributed optimization with diminishing step sizes, the proposed algorithms with fixed step size have better convergence rate. Simulation results on a numerical example are presented to substantiate the performance and characteristics of the proposed algorithms.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes the application of K-means clustering to the energy profiles following the grand coalition optimization. The cooperative model is run with the “clustered players” to compute their payoff allocations, which are then further distributed among the prosumers within each cluster.

abstract={This paper has focused on transactive energy management in local energy communities and proposes a coalitional game model which considers the presence and utilization of flexible loads and the uncertainties in renewable energy sources. The superadditivi-ty and balancedness of the proposed game model have been proved rigorously by demonstrating that a nucleolus-based solu-tion leads to a stable and fair payoff distribution scheme for all players. More specifically, the objective function has been proved concave with its analytical expression, derived through an ap-proximated piecewise linear function. The proposed allocation of realized payoffs has then been proved to converge consistently to a nucleolus-based solution. Through numerical analyses, it has been demonstrated that the grand coalition effectively increases the global payoff and the proposed allocation scheme contributes to peak shaving and valley filling in the network's profile.},

abstract={Micro-grid distribution networks that use distributed energy sources are expected to lie at the heart of the emerging smart grid technology. While existing approaches have focused on control and communication aspects in micro-grids, this paper use coalitional game theory to study novel cooperative strategies between the micro-grids of a distribution network. For this purpose, a coalitional game is formulated between a number of micro-grids (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines, PHEVs, etc.) that are, each, servicing a group of consumers (or an area) and that are connected to a macro-grid substation. For forming coalitions, an algorithm is proposed to allow the micro-grids to autonomously cooperate and self-organize into a partition composed of disjoint micro-grid coalitions. Each formed coalition consists of micro-grids that have a surplus of power to transfer or sell and of micro-grids that need to buy or acquire additional power to meet their demand. Within every coalition, the micro-grids coordinate the power transfer among themselves as well as with the macro-grid station, in a way to optimize a utility function that captures the total losses over the distribution power lines. Also, the proposed algorithm allows the micro-grids, in a distributed manner, to self-adapt to environmental changes such as variations in the power needs of the micro-grids. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields a reduction in terms of the average power losses (over the distribution line) per micro-grid, reaching up to 31% improvement relative to the non-cooperative case.},

The objective is to achieve a solution in which the ultimate beneficiaries are the prosumers, i.e., a prosumer-centric solution. To do so, a coalition formation game is designed, which enables a prosumer to compare its benefit of participating in the peer-to-peer trading with and without using its battery and thus, allows the prosumer to form suitable social coalition groups with other similar prosumers in the network for conducting peer-to-peer trading. The properties of the formed coalitions are studied, and it is shown that (1) the coalition structure that stems from the social cooperation between participating prosumers at each time slot is both stable and optimal, and (2) the outcomes of the proposed peer-to-peer trading scheme are prosumer-centric. Case studies are conducted based on real household energy usage and solar generation data to highlight how the proposed scheme can benefit prosumers through exhibiting prosumer-centric properties."

The LP formulation is based on the equivalent minimization of the epigraph. This formulation considers ramping and capacity constraints, charging and discharging efficiency losses of the storage, inelastic consumer load and local renewable generation in presence of net-metering which facilitates selling of energy to the grid and incentivizes consumers to install renewable generation and energy storage. We consider the case where the consumer loads, electricity prices, and renewable generations at different instances are uncertain. These uncertain quantities are predicted using an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and used in a model predictive control (MPC) framework to obtain the arbitrage decision at each instance. In numerical results we present the sensitivity analysis of storage performing arbitrage with varying ramping batteries and different ratio of selling and buying price of electricity.},

Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) presented the first general model and solution concept for the multiperson cooperative theory. Stable set theory is viewed as only one of several approaches for analyzing coalitional games. This chapter focuses on the von Neumann-Morgenstern stable sets, describes their original model for the coalitional games along with some illustrations, analyzes the three-person case in detail, and discusses some of the mathematical properties of stable sets. Stable sets are defined in terms of two simple conditions: internal and external stability; along with a rather simple preference relation called “domination.” These stability concepts are rather basic and fundamental mathematical notions, and presume very little about the nature or structure of social institutions and interactions. Stable sets often predict likely social structures and how groups will organize themselves. They show the important role of minimal winning coalitions and minimal-sized veto (or blocking) coalitions. They often show how a game will decompose into subgames between critical coalitions. They exhibit a variety of standards of behavior and delineate bargaining ranges. They predict the formation of cartels and illustrate the stability of discrimination and its limits. Few assumptions can lead to many insights into coalition formation, competition, and distributions of wealth. There are also many situations where stable set theory matches well with experimental results. The chapter also discusses some highly undesirable properties of stable set theories."

Moreover, such data are typically measured using bi-directional meters recording only PV generation in excess of residential load rather than recording generation and load separately. In this paper, we report a publicly available dataset consisting of load and rooftop PV generation for 300 de-identified residential customers in an Australian distribution network, with load centres covering metropolitan Sydney and surrounding regional areas. The dataset spans a 3-year period, with separately reported measurements of load and PV generation at 30-min intervals. Following a detailed description of the dataset, we identify several means by which anomalous records (e.g. due to inverter failure) are identified and excised. With the resulting ‘clean’ dataset, we identify key customer-specific and aggregated characteristics of rooftop PV generation and residential load.},

abstract = "We propose a stochastic mixed integer optimization model to optimally size a solar power system and its battery storage for residential and nonresidential customers of electric power. The objective function of the model is to minimize the total cost associated with solar power system investments and the grid provided electric power over a planning horizon. We consider the uncertainty associated with solar radiation, load, and electricity price in the form of probabilistic scenarios. The model can be used with different grid pricing programs and under no net metering or net metering programs, respectively. A numerical example and its parametric analyses are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the model and develop some insights into optimal sizing of a battery storage enabled solar system. The analyses show the size of the solar system is influenced by the labor cost and the load size whereas the size of the battery storage is sensitive to the load size and the battery cost. Moreover, we find the optimal number of solar panels/batteries is larger under the net metering program than under no net metering program."

We have reviewed the literature on historical development of models for PV-battery systems sizing. A multi-period mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is then introduced with the objective of maximizing the net present value of cash flow (for investment analysis) or the savings in electricity bill (for operation scheduling). For investment decision analysis, the model is capable to identify whether it is economical to invest in PV and/or battery systems, and if positive it can find the best PV and/or battery systems from the mix of available options. Furthermore, the model defines the optimal size of selected PV and/or battery systems. The model will select one or a combination of a few systems if feasible. All these decision variables are identified concurrently with finding the optimal operation schedule of the PV and/or battery systems at each period over the planning horizon. These variables include power flows of grid-to-load, PV-to-load, battery-to-load, battery-to-grid, grid-to-battery, PV-to-battery, PV-to-grid as well as battery state-of charge. This decision support program enables the consumer (ranging from a small house to large-scale industrial plants) to implement the most efficient electricity management strategy while achieving the goal of minimizing the electricity bill."

This interplay between optimisation and allocation is the main subject of the area of operations research games. It is surveyed on the basis of a distinction between the nature of the underlying optimisation problem: connection, routing, scheduling, production and inventory.",

We then show that an optimality interval consists either of a breakpoint or the open interval between two consecutive breakpoints of the continuous piecewise linear convex function ϑ($\lambda$). As a consequence, the optimality intervals form a partition of the closed interval {\{}$\lambda$; {\textbrokenbar}ϑ($\lambda$){\textbrokenbar} < ∞{\}}. Based on these optimality intervals, we also introduce an algorithm for solving the parametric RHS LP problem which requires an LP solver as a subroutine. If a polynomial-time LP solver is used to implement this subroutine, we obtain a substantial improvement on the complexity of those parametric RHS LP instances which exhibit degeneracy. When the number of breakpoints of ϑ($\lambda$) is polynomial in terms of the size of the parametric problem, we show that the latter can be solved in polynomial time."},

It is well known that the set of dual payoffs is contained in the core, and that cores of games in which players are replicated converge to the set of dual payoffs when the number of replications tends to infinity. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for finite convergence. As corollaries we strengthen a sufficient condition due to Owen and obtain new conditions as well. We also study conditions in which the core and the set of dual payoffs coincide even without replication. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for this phenomenon and present two classes of LP-games with this property which properly subsumes all examples of this type discussed in the literature.},

abstract={Future electricity distribution grids will host a considerable share of variable renewable energy sources and local storage resources. Moreover, they will face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric vehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production. We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that responds to both prosumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such markets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and realistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of appropriate mechanisms and incentives.},

abstract={Future electricity distribution grids will host a considerable share of the renewable energy sources needed for enforcing the energy transition. Demand side management mechanisms play a key role in the integration of such renewable energy resources by exploiting the flexibility of elastic loads, generation or electricity storage technologies. In particular, local energy markets enable households to exchange energy with each other while increasing the amount of renewable energy that is consumed locally. Nevertheless, as most ex-ante mechanisms, local market schedules rely on hour-ahead forecasts whose accuracy may be low. In this paper we cope with forecast errors by proposing a game theory approach to model the interactions among prosumers and distribution system operators for the control of electricity flows in real-time. The presented game has an aggregative equilibrium which can be attained in a semi-distributed manner, driving prosumers towards a final exchange of energy with the grid that benefits both households and operators, favoring the enforcement of prosumers' local market commitments while respecting the constraints defined by the operator. The proposed mechanism requires only one-to-all broadcast of price signals, which do not depend either on the amount of players or their local objective function and constraints, making the approach highly scalable. Its impact on distribution grid quality of supply was evaluated through load flow analysis and realistic load profiles, demonstrating the capacity of the mechanism ensure that voltage deviation and thermal limit constraints are respected.},

abstract={The sharing economy has upset the market for housing and transportation services. Homeowners can rent out their property when they are away on vacation, car owners can offer ridesharing services. These sharing economy business models are based on monetizing under-utilized infrastructure. They are enabled by peer-to-peer platforms that match eager sellers with willing buyers. Are there compelling sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector? What products or services can be shared in tomorrow's smart grid? We begin by exploring sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector, and discuss regulatory and technical obstacles to these opportunities. We then study the specific problem of a collection of firms sharing their electricity storage. We characterize equilibrium prices for shared storage in a spot market. We formulate storage investment decisions of the firms as a non-convex non-cooperative game. We show that under a mild alignment condition, a Nash equilibrium exists, it is unique, and it supports the social welfare. We discuss technology platforms necessary for the physical exchange of power, and market platforms necessary to trade electricity storage. We close with synthetic examples to illustrate our ideas.},
