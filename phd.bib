abstract={The advances in distributed renewable generation technologies in recent years have started to cause load balancing issues in power networks. Distributed energy storage (ES) systems, although seen as a tool to mitigate the stress on local networks, tend to be operated only to minimize the energy cost of their direct owner. In this paper, cooperative game theory is used to construct an energy grand coalition, in which ES system operations are optimized to minimize the coalitional energy cost. Case studies then show that forming energy coalitions is effective in reducing the variability of a local network load profile. The resulting cooperative game is mathematically proven to be balanced, which means the energy cost savings from the cooperative ES operation can be allocated to the players within the energy grand coalition in a manner that disincentivizes them from exiting from the grand coalition to form smaller coalitions.},

abstract={Distributed energy storage (ES) is widely regarded as a tool to mitigate the supply-demand imbalance caused by intermittent generations and variable loads in a distribution network. Because a retail supplier generally offers a lower electricity sell price (e.g. feed-in tariff) than its buy price, ES owners are monetarily incentivized to store excess generation for later usage. However, since each ES owner typically optimizes the ES operation based on their individual usage profile, the joint load balancing effect of multiple ES systems becomes insignificant. This paper proposes an energy coalition, in which ES system owners operate collaboratively to minimize the total coalitional energy cost. Using cooperative game theory, the nucleolus and Shapley value are developed as methods to reward players. Finally, selected case studies compare the load balancing effectiveness of noncooperative and cooperative ES operations, and empirically demonstrate the nucleolus's stablizing characteristic, which incentivizes prosumers to stay within the grand coalition.},

abstract = "Peer-to-peer trading in energy networks is expected to be exclusively conducted by the prosumers of the network with negligible influence from the grid. This raises the critical question: how can enough prosumers be encouraged to participate in peer-to-peer trading so as to make its operation sustainable and beneficial to the overall electricity network? To this end, this paper proposes how a motivational psychology framework can be used effectively to design peer-to-peer energy trading to increase user participation. To do so, first, the state-of-the-art of peer-to-peer energy trading literature is discussed by following a systematic classification, and gaps in existing studies are identified. Second, a motivation psychology framework is introduced, which consists of a number of motivational models that a prosumer needs to satisfy before being convinced to participate in energy trading. Third, a game-theoretic peer-to-peer energy trading scheme is developed, its relevant properties are studied, and it is shown that the coalition among different prosumers is a stable coalition. Fourth, through numerical case studies, it is shown that the proposed model can reduce carbon emissions by 18.38% and 9.82% in a single day in Summer and Winter respectively compared to a feed-in-tariff scheme. The proposed scheme is also shown to reduce the cost of energy up to 118 ¢ and 87 ¢ per day in Summer and Winter respectively. Finally, how the outcomes of the scheme satisfy all the motivational psychology models is discussed, which subsequently shows its potential to attract users to participate in energy trading."

abstract={In this technical note, we are concerned with constrained consensus algorithms for distributed convex optimization with a sum of convex objective functions subject to local bound and equality constraints. In multiagent networks, each agent has its own data on objective function and constraints. All the agents cooperatively find the minimizer, while each agent can only communicate with its neighbors. The consensus of multiagent networks with time-invariant and undirected graphs is proven by the Lyapunov method. Compared with existing consensus algorithms for distributed optimization with diminishing step sizes, the proposed algorithms with fixed step size have better convergence rate. Simulation results on a numerical example are presented to substantiate the performance and characteristics of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract={Among the various market structures under peer-to-peer energy sharing, one model based on cooperative game theory provides clear incentives for prosumers to collaboratively schedule their energy resources. The computational complexity of this model, however, increases exponentially with the number of participants. To address this issue, this paper proposes the application of K-means clustering to the energy profiles following the grand coalition optimization. The cooperative model is run with the “clustered players” to compute their payoff allocations, which are then further distributed among the prosumers within each cluster. Case studies show that the proposed method can significantly improve the scalability of the cooperative scheme while maintaining a high level of financial incentives for the prosumers.},

abstract={This paper has focused on transactive energy management in local energy communities and proposes a coalitional game model which considers the presence and utilization of flexible loads and the uncertainties in renewable energy sources. The superadditivi-ty and balancedness of the proposed game model have been proved rigorously by demonstrating that a nucleolus-based solu-tion leads to a stable and fair payoff distribution scheme for all players. More specifically, the objective function has been proved concave with its analytical expression, derived through an ap-proximated piecewise linear function. The proposed allocation of realized payoffs has then been proved to converge consistently to a nucleolus-based solution. Through numerical analyses, it has been demonstrated that the grand coalition effectively increases the global payoff and the proposed allocation scheme contributes to peak shaving and valley filling in the network's profile.},

abstract={Micro-grid distribution networks that use distributed energy sources are expected to lie at the heart of the emerging smart grid technology. While existing approaches have focused on control and communication aspects in micro-grids, this paper use coalitional game theory to study novel cooperative strategies between the micro-grids of a distribution network. For this purpose, a coalitional game is formulated between a number of micro-grids (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines, PHEVs, etc.) that are, each, servicing a group of consumers (or an area) and that are connected to a macro-grid substation. For forming coalitions, an algorithm is proposed to allow the micro-grids to autonomously cooperate and self-organize into a partition composed of disjoint micro-grid coalitions. Each formed coalition consists of micro-grids that have a surplus of power to transfer or sell and of micro-grids that need to buy or acquire additional power to meet their demand. Within every coalition, the micro-grids coordinate the power transfer among themselves as well as with the macro-grid station, in a way to optimize a utility function that captures the total losses over the distribution power lines. Also, the proposed algorithm allows the micro-grids, in a distributed manner, to self-adapt to environmental changes such as variations in the power needs of the micro-grids. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields a reduction in terms of the average power losses (over the distribution line) per micro-grid, reaching up to 31% improvement relative to the non-cooperative case.},

abstract = "This paper studies a social cooperation backed peer-to-peer energy trading technique by which prosumers can decide how they can use their batteries opportunistically for participating in the peer-to-peer trading. The objective is to achieve a solution in which the ultimate beneficiaries are the prosumers, i.e., a prosumer-centric solution. To do so, a coalition formation game is designed, which enables a prosumer to compare its benefit of participating in the peer-to-peer trading with and without using its battery and thus, allows the prosumer to form suitable social coalition groups with other similar prosumers in the network for conducting peer-to-peer trading. The properties of the formed coalitions are studied, and it is shown that (1) the coalition structure that stems from the social cooperation between participating prosumers at each time slot is both stable and optimal, and (2) the outcomes of the proposed peer-to-peer trading scheme are prosumer-centric. Case studies are conducted based on real household energy usage and solar generation data to highlight how the proposed scheme can benefit prosumers through exhibiting prosumer-centric properties."
