abstract={The advances in distributed renewable generation technologies in recent years have started to cause load balancing issues in power networks. Distributed energy storage (ES) systems, although seen as a tool to mitigate the stress on local networks, tend to be operated only to minimize the energy cost of their direct owner. In this paper, cooperative game theory is used to construct an energy grand coalition, in which ES system operations are optimized to minimize the coalitional energy cost. Case studies then show that forming energy coalitions is effective in reducing the variability of a local network load profile. The resulting cooperative game is mathematically proven to be balanced, which means the energy cost savings from the cooperative ES operation can be allocated to the players within the energy grand coalition in a manner that disincentivizes them from exiting from the grand coalition to form smaller coalitions.},

abstract={Distributed energy storage (ES) is widely regarded as a tool to mitigate the supply-demand imbalance caused by intermittent generations and variable loads in a distribution network. Because a retail supplier generally offers a lower electricity sell price (e.g. feed-in tariff) than its buy price, ES owners are monetarily incentivized to store excess generation for later usage. However, since each ES owner typically optimizes the ES operation based on their individual usage profile, the joint load balancing effect of multiple ES systems becomes insignificant. This paper proposes an energy coalition, in which ES system owners operate collaboratively to minimize the total coalitional energy cost. Using cooperative game theory, the nucleolus and Shapley value are developed as methods to reward players. Finally, selected case studies compare the load balancing effectiveness of noncooperative and cooperative ES operations, and empirically demonstrate the nucleolus's stablizing characteristic, which incentivizes prosumers to stay within the grand coalition.},

abstract = "Peer-to-peer trading in energy networks is expected to be exclusively conducted by the prosumers of the network with negligible influence from the grid. This raises the critical question: how can enough prosumers be encouraged to participate in peer-to-peer trading so as to make its operation sustainable and beneficial to the overall electricity network? To this end, this paper proposes how a motivational psychology framework can be used effectively to design peer-to-peer energy trading to increase user participation. To do so, first, the state-of-the-art of peer-to-peer energy trading literature is discussed by following a systematic classification, and gaps in existing studies are identified. Second, a motivation psychology framework is introduced, which consists of a number of motivational models that a prosumer needs to satisfy before being convinced to participate in energy trading. Third, a game-theoretic peer-to-peer energy trading scheme is developed, its relevant properties are studied, and it is shown that the coalition among different prosumers is a stable coalition. Fourth, through numerical case studies, it is shown that the proposed model can reduce carbon emissions by 18.38% and 9.82% in a single day in Summer and Winter respectively compared to a feed-in-tariff scheme. The proposed scheme is also shown to reduce the cost of energy up to 118 ¢ and 87 ¢ per day in Summer and Winter respectively. Finally, how the outcomes of the scheme satisfy all the motivational psychology models is discussed, which subsequently shows its potential to attract users to participate in energy trading."

abstract={In this technical note, we are concerned with constrained consensus algorithms for distributed convex optimization with a sum of convex objective functions subject to local bound and equality constraints. In multiagent networks, each agent has its own data on objective function and constraints. All the agents cooperatively find the minimizer, while each agent can only communicate with its neighbors. The consensus of multiagent networks with time-invariant and undirected graphs is proven by the Lyapunov method. Compared with existing consensus algorithms for distributed optimization with diminishing step sizes, the proposed algorithms with fixed step size have better convergence rate. Simulation results on a numerical example are presented to substantiate the performance and characteristics of the proposed algorithms.},
