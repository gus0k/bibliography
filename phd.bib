abstract={The advances in distributed renewable generation technologies in recent years have started to cause load balancing issues in power networks. Distributed energy storage (ES) systems, although seen as a tool to mitigate the stress on local networks, tend to be operated only to minimize the energy cost of their direct owner. In this paper, cooperative game theory is used to construct an energy grand coalition, in which ES system operations are optimized to minimize the coalitional energy cost. Case studies then show that forming energy coalitions is effective in reducing the variability of a local network load profile. The resulting cooperative game is mathematically proven to be balanced, which means the energy cost savings from the cooperative ES operation can be allocated to the players within the energy grand coalition in a manner that disincentivizes them from exiting from the grand coalition to form smaller coalitions.},

abstract={Distributed energy storage (ES) is widely regarded as a tool to mitigate the supply-demand imbalance caused by intermittent generations and variable loads in a distribution network. Because a retail supplier generally offers a lower electricity sell price (e.g. feed-in tariff) than its buy price, ES owners are monetarily incentivized to store excess generation for later usage. However, since each ES owner typically optimizes the ES operation based on their individual usage profile, the joint load balancing effect of multiple ES systems becomes insignificant. This paper proposes an energy coalition, in which ES system owners operate collaboratively to minimize the total coalitional energy cost. Using cooperative game theory, the nucleolus and Shapley value are developed as methods to reward players. Finally, selected case studies compare the load balancing effectiveness of noncooperative and cooperative ES operations, and empirically demonstrate the nucleolus's stablizing characteristic, which incentivizes prosumers to stay within the grand coalition.},
