### Cooperative games

*  Incentivizing Prosumer Coalitions with Energy Management Using Cooperative Game Theory [@han2019incentivizing].

The authors detail a model using cooperative game theory in which prosumers with storage can join collations to reduce their costs by co optimizing. They prove that the game they proposed is balanced. That implies that the nucleous is in the core. For small number of players they compare the Shapely value and the nucleous. They mention that complexity is a problem. They also evaluate the impact of forecast on the overall gains.

*  Constructing Prosumer Coalitions for Energy Cost Savings Using Cooperative Game Theory [@han2018constructing]

This is the conference version of [@han2019incentivizing], should cite the journal version as its more recent and complete.

* A motivational game-theoretic approach for peer-to-peer energy trading in the smart grid [@tushar2019motivational]

The paper studies P2P trading without storage. They propose a cooperative game to quantity the trade inside a coalition and they show that the value function is concave and superadditive, so the core is not empty.

### Distributed Optimization

* Constrained Consensus Algorithms With Fixed Step Size for Distributed Convex Optimization Over Multiagent Networks [@liu2017constrained]

The paper proposes a distributed consensus algorithm to minimize a convex function over an undirected graph where agents have private values and constraints.
