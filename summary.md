### Cooperative games

*  Incentivizing Prosumer Coalitions with Energy Management Using Cooperative Game Theory [@han2019incentivizing].

The authors detail a model using cooperative game theory in which prosumers with storage can join collations to reduce their costs by co optimizing. They prove that the game they proposed is balanced. That implies that the nucleous is in the core. For small number of players they compare the Shapely value and the nucleous. They mention that complexity is a problem. They also evaluate the impact of forecast on the overall gains.

*  Constructing Prosumer Coalitions for Energy Cost Savings Using Cooperative Game Theory [@han2018constructing]

This is the conference version of [@han2019incentivizing], should cite the journal version as its more recent and complete.
